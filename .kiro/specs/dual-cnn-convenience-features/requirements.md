# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds convenience methods to the LSM Lite system to streamline the dual CNN training workflow. The goal is to provide a simplified interface that handles the complete pipeline: fitting embedders, initializing attentive reservoirs, setting up CNNs for next-token prediction with rolling wave output storage, and using a second CNN for final token prediction generation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a machine learning researcher, I want a single method to fit an embedder and initialize the complete dual CNN pipeline, so that I can quickly set up experiments without manually configuring each component.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user calls a convenience method with training data THEN the system SHALL automatically fit an embedder to the data
2. WHEN the embedder is fitted THEN the system SHALL initialize an attentive reservoir with appropriate parameters
3. WHEN the reservoir is initialized THEN the system SHALL set up the first CNN for next-token prediction
4. WHEN the first CNN is configured THEN the system SHALL enable rolling wave output storage
5. WHEN rolling wave storage is enabled THEN the system SHALL initialize the second CNN for final token prediction
6. IF any component initialization fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating which step failed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the convenience features to integrate seamlessly with the existing LSM Lite architecture, so that I can use them alongside existing functionality without conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN convenience methods are used THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing LSM Lite APIs
2. WHEN components are initialized through convenience methods THEN they SHALL be accessible through standard LSM Lite interfaces
3. WHEN using convenience features THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing configuration options as optional parameters
4. IF a user wants to customize specific components THEN the system SHALL allow overriding default parameters

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the rolling wave output to be automatically stored and managed, so that I can focus on model training rather than data pipeline management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the first CNN processes input THEN the system SHALL automatically capture rolling wave outputs
2. WHEN rolling wave outputs are captured THEN the system SHALL store them in an efficient format for the second CNN
3. WHEN storage reaches capacity limits THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate memory management strategies
4. WHEN the second CNN needs input THEN the system SHALL automatically provide the stored rolling wave data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a machine learning practitioner, I want clear feedback on the training progress and component status, so that I can monitor the dual CNN training process effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are being initialized THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators
2. WHEN training is in progress THEN the system SHALL display relevant metrics for both CNNs
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages with suggested solutions
4. WHEN training completes THEN the system SHALL summarize the results and model performance

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the convenience features to handle common configuration patterns automatically, so that I can get started quickly with sensible defaults while retaining customization options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN no specific parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL use intelligent defaults based on input data characteristics
2. WHEN the user provides partial configuration THEN the system SHALL fill in remaining parameters with appropriate defaults
3. WHEN advanced users need full control THEN the system SHALL expose all underlying configuration options
4. IF configuration conflicts arise THEN the system SHALL validate parameters and provide clear guidance
