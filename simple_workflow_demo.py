Simple LSM Lite Workflow Demo

A streamlined example showing the essential workflow using the LSM Lite API:
- Initialize system with sample data
- Set up dual CNN pipeline (embedder + next-token CNN + response CNN)
- Train the system
- Generate text

This script focuses on the core API usage without extensive simulation.
